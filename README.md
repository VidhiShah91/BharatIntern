# BharatIntern Web Development Internship

Welcome to my BharatIntern Web Development Internship repository! In this internship, I had the opportunity to work on three exciting web development tasks. Let's take a closer look at each of them:

## Task 1: Portfolio Website

As part of the internship, I created a personal portfolio website. This website showcases my skills, experience, and provides a brief introduction about me. It serves as a digital resume, allowing me to share my work and projects with the world. The portfolio website is designed to be responsive and visually appealing.

### Features:
- A professional and responsive design.
- A dedicated section for my bio, highlighting my background and skills.
- A portfolio section showcasing some of the projects I've worked on.
- Contact information, including links to my social media profiles and email address.

Check out my portfolio website to learn more about my skills and experiences!

## Task 2: Temperature Converter

In the second task, I developed a temperature converter web application. This application allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. It's a practical utility tool that can be used to perform temperature conversions quickly and accurately.

### Features:
- A user-friendly interface for inputting temperatures.
- Real-time conversion as you type.
- Support for multiple temperature units (Celsius, Fahrenheit).

Try out the Temperature Converter to easily switch between temperature units and make conversions on the fly!

## Task 3: Netflix Homepage Clone

The third and final task involved creating a clone of the Netflix homepage. The Netflix homepage clone replicates the appearance of the Netflix landing page, including the layout, images, and functionality. This task allowed me to practice front-end web development skills, including HTML, CSS.

### Features:
- A faithful reproduction of the Netflix homepage.
- A responsive design to ensure compatibility with various devices.

I hope you find these web development projects interesting and informative. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to sharing more of my work and projects with you in the future.
